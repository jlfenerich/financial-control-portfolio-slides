## Workflow

<div style="font-size:28px">

### 1. Data Access and Extraction
The client accesses their accounts to obtain the necessary financial data. This data is extracted and saved as PDFs.

### 2. Data Normalization and Categorization
The extracted data is transcribed and normalized into a Google Sheets document using a PDF data extraction tool. Then, the data is categorized to facilitate analysis.

### 3. Dashboard Creation and Data Analysis
Using Looker, a dashboard is configured to access the categorized data in Google Sheets, displaying various visualizations.

### 4. Publication and Access to Analyses
The analyses are compiled and published on the Obsidian site, allowing secure and easy access to financial insights.
